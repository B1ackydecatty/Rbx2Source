ROBLOX TO SOURCE ENGINE CONVERTER
=====================

In recent times, various roblox users (including myself) have been experimenting 
with porting roblox assets and characters into the source engine. 

It is usually a hassle to do, but with my Roblox to Source Converter tool, porting 
roblox characters and assets into the source engine has never been easier! 

All you have to do is:

- 1: Give the application a Source Game to compile for, 
- 2: Input a player's username or a hat/gear's assetid
- 3: Press the compile button
- 4: Enjoy.



I'm hosting the source code of my application here. 
Feel free to pitch any changes if needed.

Yeah yeah... I know, I hate these too. 
But I put a lot of work into this program so I need to make sure its used fairly.
